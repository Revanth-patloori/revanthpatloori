this project is based on the cognitive disorders of senior citizens.It is bulit using the concepts of RDMBS and Also Java AWT,
Swing interface is used to built the front end.Here i ahve created around 4 table to store the "basic details of the senior citizens" such as
the essential details such His/Her name,Gender,Mobile number,Age etc.Another table is used to store the "habits of each individual citizen" listed in the first table.
Similarly I have even created tables such as "symptoms and medical history" where the medical history table is used to store the previous medical records of the citizens;
and the Symptoms the are facing.I used the concepts of "entity-relation sets" to link or build a "relation ship between correspondind tables such as symptoms
and medical history."

FRONTEND
I have built the front end using Java Awt and Swing classes where I have built or created various pages such as Login panel,Signup panel.
A home page where all the details of the senior citizen such as medical history and basic details who have logged in is displayed.

I have used the concepts of "JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY" to link the Front end and the tables in the database.
So that we could retrive the details of the dsenior citizens from the DataBase tables and paste them on the Frontend.
